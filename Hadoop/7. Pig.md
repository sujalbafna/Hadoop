**Pig (Data Access and Querying in Hadoop Ecosystem)**

**Definition:**
Apache Pig is a high-level platform for creating programs that run on Apache Hadoop. It uses a language called Pig Latin, which is a data flow language that abstracts the complexity of writing raw MapReduce programs. Pig is especially useful for processing and analyzing large datasets in a simple and flexible way.

**Basic Pig Commands with Example Outputs:**

1. **Start Pig in Grunt Shell (Local Mode)**
```bash
pig -x local
```
**Output:**
```
grunt>
```

2. **Load Data into a Relation**
```pig
student_data = LOAD '/home/hadoop/student_data.txt' USING PigStorage(',') AS (id:int, name:chararray, age:int);
```
**Output:**
```
(student_data: relation)
```

3. **Display Data**
```pig
DUMP student_data;
```
**Output:**
```
(1,John,22)
(2,Mary,23)
(3,Steve,21)
```

4. **Describe a Relation**
```pig
DESCRIBE student_data;
```
**Output:**
```
student_data: {id: int, name: chararray, age: int}
```

5. **Filter Records**
```pig
students_age_22 = FILTER student_data BY age == 22;
DUMP students_age_22;
```
**Output:**
```
(1,John,22)
```

6. **Group Records**
```pig
grouped_data = GROUP student_data BY age;
DUMP grouped_data;
```
**Output:**
```
(22,{(1,John,22)})
(23,{(2,Mary,23)})
(21,{(3,Steve,21)})
```

7. **Generate New Data**
```pig
names_only = FOREACH student_data GENERATE name;
DUMP names_only;
```
**Output:**
```
(John)
(Mary)
(Steve)
```

8. **Order Data**
```pig
ordered_data = ORDER student_data BY age DESC;
DUMP ordered_data;
```
**Output:**
```
(2,Mary,23)
(1,John,22)
(3,Steve,21)
```

9. **Store Data into a File**
```pig
STORE students_age_22 INTO '/home/hadoop/output' USING PigStorage(',');
```
**Output:**
```
(no console output, data is stored in the specified directory)
```

10. **Illustrate the Data Flow**
```pig
ILLUSTRATE student_data;
```
**Output:**
```
---------------------------------------------
| id | name | age |
---------------------------------------------
| 1  | John | 22  |
| 2  | Mary | 23  |
| 3  | Steve| 21  |
---------------------------------------------
```

11. **Explain the Logical Execution Plan**
```pig
EXPLAIN student_data;
```
**Output:**
```
Logical Plan:
... (Shows logical steps like load, filter, etc.)
```

12. **Exit the Grunt Shell**
```bash
quit
```
**Output:**
```
Exiting Pig Shell!
```

**Summary:**
Apache Pig simplifies complex data transformations by offering a higher-level abstraction using the Pig Latin language. It is well-suited for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and is efficient in managing large volumes of semi-structured data on Hadoop clusters.
