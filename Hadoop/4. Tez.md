**Tez (Data Processing in Hadoop)**

**Definition:**
Apache Tez is a powerful and flexible framework that allows for a complex directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) of tasks for processing data across a Hadoop cluster. It improves upon the traditional MapReduce by allowing more efficient data processing through fewer disk writes and more optimized job execution. Tez is commonly used by higher-level tools like Hive, Pig, and others to achieve faster performance.

**Basic Tez Commands with Example Outputs:**

1. **Enable Tez Execution Engine in Hive**
```sql
set hive.execution.engine=tez;
```
**Output:**
```
OK
```

2. **Submit a Hive Query Using Tez**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';
```
**Output:**
```
Query ID = hadoop_20250427120000
Total jobs = 1
Launching Job 1 out of 1
Status: Finished successfully
```

3. **View Running Tez Applications**
```bash
yarn application -list
```
**Output:**
```
Total number of applications (application-types: [TEZ], states: [RUNNING]): 0
```

4. **Kill a Tez Application**
```bash
yarn application -kill <application_id>
```
**Output:**
```
Killing application application_168243_0004
```

5. **Check Tez UI for Application DAGs**
```
URL: http://<ResourceManager_IP>:8080/tez-ui/
```
**Output:**
- Opens the Tez UI showing DAGs, vertices, and execution status.

6. **View Tez Application Logs**
```bash
yarn logs -applicationId <application_id>
```
**Output:**
```
INFO tez.TaskAttemptImpl: Attempt succeeded attempt_168243_0004_m_000000
```

7. **Run a Sample Tez Job Manually (Optional)**
```bash
yarn jar /usr/hdp/current/tez-client/tez-examples-*.jar orderedwordcount /input /output
```
**Output:**
```
INFO tez.Client: DAG completed successfully
```

8. **Set Tez-specific Configurations in Hive**
```sql
set tez.grouping.min-size=16777216;
set tez.grouping.max-size=1073741824;
```
**Output:**
```
OK
OK
```

9. **Check Detailed DAG Information via Tez View**
- Visit the Tez View in Ambari or standalone Tez UI.

**Output:**
- Graphical display of DAG execution stages, counters, and performance metrics.

10. **Clean Tez Staging Directory (Optional for Admins)**
```bash
hdfs dfs -rm -r /tmp/hadoop-yarn/staging/history/done_intermediate
```
**Output:**
```
Deleted /tmp/hadoop-yarn/staging/history/done_intermediate
```
Summary: Tez modernizes Hadoop data processing by enabling more flexible workflows, reducing overhead, and increasing the efficiency of large-scale data analytics. Its commands and configurations allow users to run faster, more optimized queries compared to traditional MapReduce.
