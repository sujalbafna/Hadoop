**MapReduce (Data Processing in Hadoop)**

**Definition:**
MapReduce is a programming model and processing technique for distributed computing based on Java. It allows for the processing of large data sets with a distributed algorithm on a Hadoop cluster. MapReduce works in two phases:

1. **Map Phase** - Takes input data and converts it into a set of intermediate key-value pairs.
2. **Reduce Phase** - Merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.

MapReduce simplifies data processing across thousands of servers in a Hadoop cluster.

**Basic MapReduce Commands with Example Outputs:**

1. **Run a MapReduce Job**
```bash
yarn jar /path/to/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar wordcount /input /output
```
**Output:**
```
INFO mapreduce.Job: Running job: job_168243_0001
INFO mapreduce.Job: Job job_168243_0001 completed successfully
```

2. **Check the Status of Running Jobs**
```bash
yarn application -list
```
**Output:**
```
Total number of applications (application-types: [MAPREDUCE], states: [RUNNING]):0
```

3. **View Job History**
```bash
yarn application -status <application_id>
```
**Output:**
```
Application Report :
	Application-Id : application_168243_0001
	Application-State : FINISHED
	Final-State : SUCCEEDED
```

4. **Kill a Running Job**
```bash
yarn application -kill <application_id>
```
**Output:**
```
Killing application application_168243_0002
```

5. **View MapReduce Job Output**
```bash
hdfs dfs -cat /output/part-r-00000
```
**Output:**
```
Hadoop 5
MapReduce 10
BigData 7
```

6. **Check the Job History Server Web UI**
```
URL: http://<ResourceManager_IP>:19888/jobhistory
```
**Output:**
- Opens a web interface showing all MapReduce job histories.

7. **Remove Previous Output Directory Before Running a New Job**
```bash
hdfs dfs -rm -r /output
```
**Output:**
```
Deleted /output
```

8. **Running a Custom MapReduce Program**
```bash
yarn jar MyCustomJob.jar com.example.MyDriver /input /output
```
**Output:**
```
INFO mapreduce.Job: Running job: job_168243_0003
INFO mapreduce.Job: Job job_168243_0003 completed successfully
```

9. **See Logs of a MapReduce Job**
```bash
yarn logs -applicationId <application_id>
```
**Output:**
```
INFO mapreduce.Job: Task succeeded task_168243_0001_m_000000
...
```

10. **List all MapReduce Examples Available**
```bash
yarn jar /path/to/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar
```
**Output:**
```
An example program must be given as the first argument.
Valid program names are:
  wordcount
  grep
  teragen
  terasort
  teravalidate
  pi
```
Summary: MapReduce is an efficient way to process massive amounts of data in parallel across a Hadoop cluster. Its commands help users submit, monitor, manage, and troubleshoot jobs effectively.
